          <h1>Tutorial, Fibnacci</h1>
          <span class="label label-default">2015-02-05</span>
          <p>In this tutorial, we compare two version of Fibnacci sequence, to
            demo recursion and memorization. Please also pay attention to the
            analysis of complexity.</p>

          <h1>Fibancci Sequence</h1>
          <p>Fibnacci sequence is a very famous number sequence, which was first introduced
            by Leonardo Fibnacci in considering the growth of rabbits population in a
            ideal model. Fibnacci assumes that a pair of rabbits elder than 1 months gives
            a new pair of rabbits every month, and rabbits never die. The number of
            rabbits pairs in n-th month start from one pair of newly born rabbits is the
            so called n-th Fibnacci number, denoted by F(n). It's easy to get:</p>

          $$F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1, F(3) = 2, F(4) = 3.$$

          <p>Generally, the rabbit pairs in n-th month equal to the rabbit pairs in \((n -
            1)\)-th month plus the newly born rabbit pairs. The newly born rabbit pairs in
            n-th month equal to the rabbit pairs in (n - 2)-th month, so we have:</p>

          $$F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2).$$

          <p>As above formula, we can define F(n) on zero and negaitve numbers as:</p>

          $$F(n) = F(n + 2) - F(n + 1).$$

          <p>With this extension, it can be proved that \(F(-n) = -F(n)\). But this
            tutorial, we only consider \(F(0) = 1\) and positive numbers.</p>

          <h1>Recursive Version</h1>
          <p>According to this forumla, it is very easy to calculate n-th
            Fibnacci number:</p>
          <pre>
def RecursiveFibnacci(n):
  """Returns n-th Fibnacci number.

  >>> RecursiveFibnacci(0)
  0

  >>> RecursiveFibnacci(1)
  1

  >>> RecursiveFibnacci(10)
  55
  """
  assert isinstance(n, int)
  assert n >= 0
  if n == 0 or n == 1:
    return n
  return RecursiveFibnacci(n - 1) + RecursiveFibnacci(n - 2)</pre>

          <p>We can check several small fibnacci numbers:</p>

          <pre>
print([(i, RecursiveFibnacci(i)) for i in range(11)])</pre>


          <p>RecursiveFibnacci calls itself, this is a classical *recusive* function. A
            function is called recursive if it calls itself directly or indirectly. To
            avoid infinite loop, we must have a break condition in a recursive
            function. In RecursiveFibnacci, we have special check for n is 0 and 1. Any
            other n will call RecursiveFibnacci with smaller value and finally gets 1 or
            0. This call stack for n = 3 is like following:</p>

          <pre>
RecursiveFibnacci(3) => RecursiveFibnacci(2) + RecursiveFibnacci(1)
RecursiveFibnacci(2) => RecursiveFibnacci(1) + RecursiveFibnacci(0)</pre>


          <p>The call stack for \(n = 5\) is like following:</p>
          <pre>
               5
              / \
             /   \
            /     3
           /     / \
          4     2   1
         / \   / \
        /   \ 1   0
       /     \
      3       2
     / \     / \
    2   1   1   0
   / \
  1   0
</pre>

          <p>As you may already know, the call stacks are duplicated a lot for
            large n. That is, a lot of Fibnacci numbers are calculated again and
            again. We can calculate the times of RecursiveFibnacci called. Let
            the times be R(n), then it is easy to get that:</p>

          $$R(0) = R(1) = 1,$$

          $$R(n) = R(n - 1) + R(n - 2) + 1.$$

          <p>We can calculate manually \(R(2) = 3, R(3) = 5, R(4) = 9, R(5) =
            15, R(6) = 25.\) But what is the value of R(100)?  That is
            1146295688027634168201. This means even if we can call
            RecursiveFibnacci once in 1 nano second, to finish <code>RecursiveFibnacci(100)</code>,
            we need about 36323 years.</p>

          <h1>Memorization Version</h1>

          <p>We have to find another quicker way to calculate fibnacci numbers. A simple
            and common way to avoid duplicated calculation is use memorization, i.e. we
            remember all already calculated values.</p>

          <pre>
# kFibnacciNumbers is used to log all already calculated fibnacci numbers.
kFibnacciNumbers = {0: 0, 1: 1}</pre>

          <pre>
def MemorizedFibnacci(n):
  """Returns n-th Fibnacci number.

  >>> MemorizedFibnacci(0)
  0

  >>> MemorizedFibnacci(1)
  1

  >>> MemorizedFibnacci(10)
  55
  """
  assert isinstance(n, int)
  assert n >= 0
  if n in kFibnacciNumbers:
    # n is already calculated, just retrieve it.
    return kFibnacciNumbers[n]
  v = MemorizedFibnacci(n - 1) + MemorizedFibnacci(n - 2)
  # Store the value for reusing.
  kFibnacciNumbers[n] = v
  return v</pre>

          <p>With this version, we can easily get Fibnacci numbers up to 100:</p>

          <pre>
print([(i, MemorizedFibnacci(i)) for i in range(100)])</pre>

          <h1>Problems</h1>

          <p><span class="label label-default">Problem 1</span> How many times <code>MemorizedFibnacci</code> will be called in
            <code>MemorizedFibnacci(100)</code> at the first time? How many
            times in the second time?</p>

          <p><span class="label label-default">Problem 2</span> Implement \(R(n)\) and verify your implementation with \(R(100)\).</p>

          <p><span class="label label-default">Problem 3</span> In Python,
            <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.0/library/time.html">time</a> module
            can be used to get the current time. Please use it to get some time
            information for <code>RecursiveFibnacci</code> and verify that they
            are in proportion with \(R(n)\).</p>
