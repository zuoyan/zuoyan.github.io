          <p>This is a simple site which I would like to share somethings I am
            interested.  I have a master degree in Mathemtics and have worked as
            a software engineer for years.</p>

          <p>Any questions, feel free to contact <a href="mailto:jiangzuoyan@gmail.com">me</a>.</p>

          <h1 id="Optimization">Optimizations</h1>

          <p>I have an idea that one day, most things can be optimized, and the
            most import and difficult thing is to find the right target to
            optimize, not how to optimize it.</p>

          <p>Most problems in computer can be viewed as an optimization problem,
            esp. in data mining fields. Today, as far as I have learned, it is
            still not easy to optimize a general problem. We have a lot tools,
            like, LDA, PSI, SVM, Gaussian Process, Regression, Boosting. I find
            it's very fun to find respective optimization versions of them. Some
            of these are already presented as optimization problems, but some of
            them are not easy to do in optimization approaches.</p>

          <p>There are two hard problems in optimization approach to most
            machine learning problems. First, there are no effective ways to
            find the global optimization point of a general problem. Second,
            there are no intuitive and direct ways to represent some domain
            experts knowledges as optimization function.</p>

          <p>Thanks to Chrome NACL, I have <a href="optimization_demo.html">an simple optimization
            implementation demo</a>(This need to load a about 1MB native
            plugin), over which, we can try simple problems with optimization
            approaches.</p>
