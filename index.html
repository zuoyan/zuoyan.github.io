<h2>About</h2>

This is a simple site which I would like to share some scopes I am interested.
I have a master degree in Mathemtics and have worked as a software engineer for
years.

<h2>Optimizations</h2>

I have an idea that one day, most things can be optimized, and the most import
and difficult thing is to find the right target to optimize, not how to optimize
it.

Most problems in computer can be viewed as an optimization problem, esp. in data
mining fields. Today, as far as I have learned, it is still not easy to optimize
a general problem. We have a lot tools, like, LDA, PSI, SVM, Gaussian Process,
Regression, Boosting. I find it's very fun to find an optimization version of
them. Some of these are already presented as optimization problems, but some of
them are not easy to do in an optimization approach.

There are two hard problems in optimization approach to most machine learning
problems. First, there are no effective ways to find the global optimization
point of a general problem. Second, there are no intuitive and direct ways to
represent some domain experts knowledges as optimization function.

Thanks to Chrome NACL, I have <a href="TODO.html">an simple optimization
implementation demo</a>, over which, we can try simple problems with
optimization approaches.
